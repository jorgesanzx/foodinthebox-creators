# Foodinthebox Creators
Meteor app for creating food recipes.

> This app is a prototype. We decided to stop developing this app and switch
> to WordPress + plugins because we were having problems with logins and
> subscriptions in mobile devices over 3G.

The goal of this app was to be used by the community of Foodinthebox to create
food recipes. We wanted food bloggers and nutritionists to earn money selling
their recipes and diets through our e-commerce.
